For Problem 1 - part g: lets make sure that we define what mu error means. Like clearly write out formula for how one defines mu error.
For problem 1 - part h: lets make sure that mu shift is defined as welll: like is it mu evalueted with Kurvature term minus mu evaluated without curvature term and without radiation term. 
 Maybe also see if there's something else to be accounted for like are we still accounting for this and that parameter.


 There's also the Mu sensitivity issue in problem one but this one may be Mykola's fault and stuff.

 For Problem 1 - part j: Tie in the instruction to part i where assumptions are made the same way.
